## Classification of Mushrooms using the Decision Tree algorithm:
Predicting if the mushroom is Edible or Poisonous using Decision tree classification algorithm. The code is implemented on both R and Python. 


## Sentiment analysis of employee reviews and building a prediction model using the results
The aim of this project is to perform Sentiment Analysis of employee reviews(Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix, Facebook and Microsoft) and build a prediction model using the results.The methodology used for this project is CRISP-DM and the model is built using Rapid Miner. The prediction model was built using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
The accuracy of the model increased by 14.72% by optimizing the model giving the final accuracy of 87.5%.
